Description: An implementation of the MCMC algorithm of system with unknow susceptbilbe loacatons.
            This is an implementation of the Gibbs sampler within Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to
            sample from the posterior distribution. In essence, it uses Gibbs steps to sample from
            the contact rate and depending on the dispersal kernel it uses either Metropolis-Hasting
            to sample from the posterior distribution of the dispersal kernel parameter. The change
            in the transmission netwrok along with the infectious peirod is then done using M-H.
            The package provide the posterior speed of wave propagation propagation.
